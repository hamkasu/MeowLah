# Public vars (embedded at build time)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is optional — when omitted the frontend proxies through
# Next.js rewrites (/v1/* -> BACKEND_URL), which avoids CORS entirely.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_or_leave_empty_for_leaflet

# Backend URL used by the Next.js rewrite proxy (server-side, not exposed to browser).
# In Railway set this to the backend service URL, e.g.:
#   BACKEND_URL=https://<backend-service>.up.railway.app
# or use Railway private networking:
#   BACKEND_URL=http://backend.railway.internal:4000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Railway sets these automatically
# PORT=3000
# HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
